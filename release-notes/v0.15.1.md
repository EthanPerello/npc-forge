# NPC Forge v0.15.1 â€“ Premium Generation & Save UX Fixes

**Release Date:** May 26, 2025

## Summary

This patch improves reliability of premium portrait generation and field regeneration on the edit screen. It also enhances the UX by keeping users on the page after saving and displaying clean, dismissible success toasts.

## Changes

### Changed
- Save to Library button now shows success notification and keeps users on current page instead of redirecting to Library
- Success messages now appear as centered toast notifications that auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

### Fixed
- Premium portrait generation now works correctly with `gpt-image-1` model
- Field regeneration on character edit pages now works reliably without errors
- AI-generated content no longer includes unwanted formatting or prefixes in regenerated fields

# NPC Forge v0.27.0 â€“ API Reliability & Portrait System Fixes

Release Date: June 10, 2025

## Summary

Resolved critical failures in character regeneration, chat functionality, and portrait display systems. Fixed API payload errors, response format issues, and IndexedDB loading inconsistencies that prevented core features from working properly.

## Changes

### Added
- Enhanced JSON parsing with multiple fallback strategies to handle malformed AI responses
- Automatic retry logic for IndexedDB image loading with exponential backoff
- Request size validation and payload cleaning to prevent oversized API calls

### Changed
- Character regeneration API response format to match frontend expectations for all field types
- PortraitDisplay component to automatically load images from IndexedDB when image data unavailable
- Character card logic to always use PortraitDisplay instead of showing fallback initials
- Error categorization system with more specific user-friendly messages across all APIs
- Usage limit checking with graceful fallbacks when localStorage is unavailable

### Fixed
- Portrait regeneration returning "Invalid response format" errors on character edit pages
- Character portraits disappearing from library when regenerating character names or other text fields
- Character portraits not appearing in library character cards despite being stored correctly in IndexedDB
- 413 "Payload Too Large" errors during character and portrait regeneration by implementing data cleaning
- Character IDs containing quotes and special characters breaking URL routing and storage operations
- Chat API failures caused by oversized character data being sent to OpenAI endpoints
- JSON parsing failures from malformed AI responses with trailing commas or incomplete formatting
- Network timeout errors during portrait generation not properly triggering retry logic
- Usage limit system errors when localStorage access is restricted or corrupted
- Portrait display cropping issues in library cards cutting off important parts of character images

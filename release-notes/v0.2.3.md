# NPC Forge v0.2.3 – Light Mode Accessibility Fixes

**Release Date:** May 2, 2025

This patch addresses a comprehensive set of light mode contrast issues across the application. It improves the readability and accessibility of UI elements such as buttons, personality traits, model selectors, documentation pages, quest type labels, success messages, and loading feedback. All selectable components now follow a consistent pattern of dark-on-light or light-on-dark based on selection state, ensuring visual clarity and a more polished user experience.

## Changed
- Replaced all native `<select>` elements across the app with a custom full-width dropdown using the existing `ui/select.tsx` component for consistent styling and improved accessibility

## Fixed
- Fixed portrait generation issue for gpt-image-1 by switching quality parameter from "hd" to "high"
- Fixed numerous contrast issues in light mode across the application:
  - Updated "Get Started", "Generate Character", and "Download JSON" buttons to maintain readability in light mode
  - Improved text visibility for selected personality traits, quest type labels, and subgenre options
  - Darkened API endpoint and contributing file references for better contrast
  - Enhanced text on changelog version numbers and roadmap priority badges
  - Ensured clear feedback for "Character generation may take a second…" and "Character successfully generated!" messages in light mode
  - Corrected contrast of selected model generation badges (e.g., "∞ left") in both character and image model selectors

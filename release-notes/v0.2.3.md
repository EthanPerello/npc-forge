# NPC Forge v0.2.3 â€“ Light Mode Accessibility Fixes

**Release Date:** 2025-05-02

This patch addresses a comprehensive set of light mode contrast issues across the application. It improves the readability and accessibility of UI elements such as buttons, personality traits, model selectors, documentation pages, quest type labels, success messages, and loading feedback. All selectable components now follow a consistent pattern of dark-on-light or light-on-dark based on selection state, ensuring visual clarity and a more polished user experience.

## Changed
- Replaced all native `<select>` elements across the app with a custom full-width dropdown using the existing `ui/select.tsx` component for consistent styling and improved accessibility.

---

## Removed
None.

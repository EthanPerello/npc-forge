# NPC Forge v0.14.0 â€“ Portrait Toggle & Random Generation Logic Update

**Release Date:** 2025-05-22

This release introduces a new user option to toggle portrait generation during character creation and rewrites the random generation logic to resolve state timing issues. It also updates model usage limits and improves the layout when portraits are not included.

## Added
- `include_portrait` toggle in concept step, allowing users to enable or disable portrait generation.

## Changed
- Rewrote random character generation logic to bypass delayed state updates and directly pass generated data to the API.
- Updated generation limits:
  - Text models: 50 (Standard), 30 (Enhanced), 10 (Premium)
  - Portrait models: 10 (Standard), 5 (Enhanced), 3 (Premium)
- Adjusted layout in the results step to a single-column format when no portrait is generated.
- Updated default text in the character description input field for clarity and consistency.
- Adjusted layout in the results step and character modal to a single-column format when no portrait is present.

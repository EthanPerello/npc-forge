# NPC Forge v0.30.0 – Code Quality & UI Refinements

**Release Date:** June 15, 2025

## Summary

This release focuses on code quality improvements, UI polish, and documentation accuracy. Enhanced regeneration outputs provide cleaner results, model selectors offer better clarity, and comprehensive documentation updates ensure consistency and accuracy throughout the project.

## Changes

### Changed
- Linted codebase with `npx eslint . --fix` to enforce consistent formatting and resolve automatic fixes
- Regeneration outputs for appearance, personality, and backstory hooks now return short, single-paragraph results instead of verbose text
- Trait regeneration updated to preserve special characters (e.g. accented letters) in display and storage
- Model selector on edit page updated to show actual model names instead of only tier labels (e.g., "gpt-4o" instead of "Premium")
- Model selection buttons restyled for consistent coloring and improved clarity when selected (helps users more easily identify the active model)

### Fixed
- Documentation updated across all files to:
  - Correct outdated framework references (e.g., "Next.js 14" → "Next.js 15")
  - Remove redundant usage tables and move technical details to developer docs
  - Ensure version badge, changelog links, and content match latest release (v0.29.0)
  - Improve formatting, accuracy, and clarity across all remaining `.md` files

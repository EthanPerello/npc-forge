# NPC Forge v0.28.0 â€“ Portrait Editing & Trait Management

Release Date: June 12, 2025

## Summary

This release introduces AI-powered portrait editing through text prompts, allowing users to modify character portraits by describing desired changes. Enhanced trait management includes individual trait regeneration controls and an AI-powered trait generator, plus improved trait filtering and display consistency throughout the interface.

## Changes

### Added
- AI-powered portrait editing via text prompts using OpenAI's `/v1/images/edits` endpoint (supports `gpt-image-1`)
- "Add Generated Trait" button in Additional Traits section to generate a new short trait via AI
- Individual regenerate buttons for each trait in the Additional Traits section

### Changed
- Trait filtering now excludes long or sentence-like traits entirely (instead of truncating them)
- Trait formatting standardized to Title Case throughout the UI
- Additional Traits display logic now matches exactly between the character modal and edit page
- Navigation back to the Library after saving changes is now immediate with no artificial delay

### Fixed
- Traits missing from the edit page but visible in the modal due to inconsistent filtering logic

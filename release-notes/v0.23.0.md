# NPC Forge v0.23.0 â€“ JSON Parsing & Portrait Retry Logic Improvements

Release Date: May 28, 2025

## Summary

This release improves API stability by introducing fallback logic for JSON parsing, extending portrait generation timeouts, and adding user-facing error feedback and retries for portrait failures.

## Changes

### Added
- Enhanced error handling with automatic retry logic for portrait generation failures
- User-friendly error messages with specific guidance for different failure types (rate limits, timeouts, network issues)
- Comprehensive JSON parsing with multiple fallback strategies to handle malformed AI responses

### Changed
- Portrait generation timeout increased from 90 to 120 seconds with automatic retry on failure
- Character generation now includes timeout protection and enhanced error recovery
- API error categorization system now provides more specific and actionable user guidance

### Fixed
- Portrait generation no longer hangs indefinitely on network timeouts or API connectivity issues
- Character generation failures due to malformed JSON responses with trailing commas or incomplete formatting
- Network timeout errors (ETIMEDOUT) now properly trigger retry logic instead of failing immediately
- Portrait regeneration reliability significantly improved with enhanced error recovery and user feedback

# NPC Forge v0.3.3 â€“ UI Polish, Model Selectors, and Storage Improvements

**Release Date:** May 7, 2025

This release finalizes the transition to IndexedDB for reliable character and portrait storage and introduces key UI enhancements across the application. The library experience is improved with additional filter options, direct delete actions on character cards, and cleaner portrait presentation. The editor now includes model selectors for portrait and text generation, alongside improved support for image upload and regeneration. Visual consistency has been enhanced through refined sticky footer layout, better button positioning, and a revamped welcome guide. Minor fixes address character duplication, disappearing images, and outdated UI messaging.

## Added
- Model selectors for text and image regeneration on the edit character page
- Upload and regenerate portrait buttons in the editor, always visible regardless of image state
- Download portrait button on the main character display
- Delete button added directly to character cards in the library list (no need to open modal)
- Full character data (not just images) now stored in IndexedDB, replacing localStorage
- Resilient IndexedDB storage with object store validation and database recovery logic
- New "Reset Database" option added when IndexedDB errors are detected
- Welcome Guide redesigned with updated visuals, icons, and steps for new users

## Changed
- Portrait controls in the editor moved below the image for better UX and layout
- Portrait now persists after saving a character to the library (no more disappearing image)
- Example characters now appear immediately on first load (no refresh needed)
- Filter dropdowns in the character library now use consistent UI components (e.g. `Select`, `SearchableSelect`)
- Modal layout spacing improved to prevent sticky footer overlap on mobile and desktop
- "Enhanced" label in the portrait model selector now aligned correctly with the card
- Removed redundant "Import Character" button from the top of the library page
- Removed "Usage varies by model tier..." footer banner from the main screen

## Fixed
- Character portraits now appear correctly in library detail view when a character is clicked
- Prevented duplicate example characters from appearing in the library
- Fixed React hook ordering violation in the CharacterLibraryPage component
- Resolved localStorage quota errors by completing the IndexedDB migration for all character data

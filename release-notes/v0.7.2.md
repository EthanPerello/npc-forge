# NPC Forge v0.7.2 – Light Mode Accessibility Improvements

**Release Date:** 2025-05-02

This release improves light mode accessibility with better contrast across UI elements, along with standardized dropdown menus for a more consistent user experience.

## Changed
- Replaced all native `<select>` elements across the app with a custom full-width dropdown using the existing `ui/select.tsx` component for consistent styling and improved accessibility

## Fixed
- Portrait generation issue for gpt-image-1 by switching quality parameter from "hd" to "high"
- Numerous contrast issues in light mode across the application:
  - Buttons such as "Get Started", "Generate Character", and "Download JSON" now maintain readability
  - Selected personality traits, quest type labels, and subgenre options have improved text visibility
  - API endpoint and contributing file references have darker text for better contrast
  - Changelog version numbers and roadmap priority badges have enhanced clarity
  - User feedback messages like "Character generation may take a second..." now display properly
  - Selected model generation badges (e.g., "∞ left") have corrected contrast in all selectors

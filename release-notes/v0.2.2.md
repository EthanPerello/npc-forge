# NPC Forge v0.2.2 – Theme & API Fixes

**Release Date:** May 1, 2025

Fixes issues with theme-aware styling, image generation parameters, and the randomize button.

## Added
- New CSS utility classes: `text-description`, `bg-secondary`, `border-theme`, and additional variants for consistent theme support
- Example-specific selectors in `globals.css` to improve the readability of dynamic example content in light mode

## Changed
- Refactored theme styling system to use standardized CSS variables and utility classes (`bg-card`, `text-muted`, `border-theme`, etc.) for consistent appearance across light and dark modes
- Simplified randomization logic in `character-form.tsx` to eliminate fragile state timing patterns
- Updated global styles to improve visibility for UI elements like subgenre text, welcome guide examples, and tabbed panels in light mode

## Fixed
- Fixed portrait generation errors by omitting unsupported parameters for DALL·E-2 and conditionally applying model-specific options
- Corrected the randomize button behavior to ensure the character description updates reliably alongside the selected genre
- Improved text contrast and accessibility in light mode across multiple components, including form labels, documentation content, and example text

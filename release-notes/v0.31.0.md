# NPC Forge v0.31.0 â€“ User Authentication & Cloud Storage

**Release Date:** June 30, 2025

## Summary

This release introduces user authentication with NextAuth.js, cloud-based character storage using Supabase, and automatic syncing across devices. Users can now sign in with Google or GitHub to access their characters from anywhere while maintaining full offline functionality.

## Changes

### Added
- User authentication system powered by NextAuth.js with support for Google and GitHub sign-in providers
- Cloud-based character storage using Prisma and Supabase with fallback to local storage for unauthenticated users
- Middleware to protect API routes and enforce authentication for cloud-backed features
- Header bar with dynamic sign-in button, user menu, and theme toggle integrated into the client layout
- Automatic syncing of user-generated characters to Supabase when logged in, with ID and timestamp preservation
- API key model and GDPR-compliant user metadata fields added to Prisma schema (unused but scaffolded for future use)

### Changed
- Sidebar layout updated to remove outdated sign-in button and improve spacing consistency across screen sizes
- Character storage logic refactored to route all storage actions through a hybrid provider supporting both IndexedDB and Supabase
- Character context and library logic updated to use new hybrid character service with automatic provider fallback

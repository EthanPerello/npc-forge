# NPC Forge v0.13.0 â€“ Model Selectors & IndexedDB Storage

Release Date: May 7, 2025

This release enhances the character editing experience with model selectors and improves data storage with IndexedDB integration, increasing reliability and capacity for character data and portraits.

## Added
- Model selectors for text and image regeneration on the edit character page
- Upload and regenerate portrait buttons in the editor, always visible regardless of image state
- Download portrait button on the main character display
- Delete button added directly to character cards in the library list (no need to open modal)
- Full character data (not just images) now stored in IndexedDB, replacing localStorage
- Resilient IndexedDB storage with object store validation and database recovery logic
- New "Reset Database" option added when IndexedDB errors are detected
- Welcome Guide redesigned with updated visuals, icons, and steps for new users

## Changed
- Portrait controls in the editor moved below the image for better UX and layout
- Portrait now persists after saving a character to the library (no more disappearing image)
- Example characters now appear immediately on first load (no refresh needed)
- Filter dropdowns in the character library now use consistent UI components (e.g. `Select`, `SearchableSelect`)
- Modal layout spacing improved to prevent sticky footer overlap on mobile and desktop
- "Enhanced" label in the portrait model selector now aligned correctly with the card

## Removed
- Redundant "Import Character" button from the top of the library page
- "Usage varies by model tier..." footer banner from the main screen

## Fixed
- Character portraits now appear correctly in library detail view when a character is clicked
- Prevented duplicate example characters from appearing in the library
- Fixed React hook ordering violation in the CharacterLibraryPage component
- Resolved localStorage quota errors by completing the IndexedDB migration for all character data

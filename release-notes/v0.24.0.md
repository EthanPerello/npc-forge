# NPC Forge v0.24.0 â€“ Enhanced Trait Filtering and Search in Library

Release Date: May 30, 2025

## Summary

This release introduces a fully overhauled trait filtering and display system in the Library. Users can now filter characters across all trait categories (e.g., Personality, Species, Occupation, Social Class), view traits with clear category prefixes, and combine dropdown filters with smart search queries. The updated filter panel improves usability through collapsible sections and better organization.

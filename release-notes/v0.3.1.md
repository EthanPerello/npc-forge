# NPC Forge v0.3.1 â€“ Library and UI Enhancements

This release enhances user experience with a sticky footer for key actions, improved character library interactions, and refined UI elements.

The update also addresses several visual styling issues and improves the organization of character traits and quest information in the edit view.

- Loading message as floating notification that appears above the sticky footer
- Delete character button in library detail view

## Changed

- Example characters can now be edited and deleted from library
- Description field automatically updates when genre changes (if not manually edited)
- Updated usage text at bottom of main page to accurately reflect tiered model system
- Removed example description box from the character description field

### Fixed
- Example characters now appear in library on first visit without requiring refresh
- Different background colors for genre vs sub-genre indicators in library
- Fixed JSON viewer text color in light mode
- Character traits now display properly in edit page with all options available
- Improved character edit page with better organization of fields

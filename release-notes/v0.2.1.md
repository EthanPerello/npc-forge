**Release Date:** 2025-04-30

This feature-rich patch introduces support for multiple model backends (text and image), a robust usage limit system with tiered access, and a complete dark mode toggle integrated with Tailwind CSS. It also brings key usability improvements to feedback messaging and a fully redesigned documentation layout with standardized visual structure and improved mobile responsiveness.

## Summary

Enhanced navigation and messaging provide better user feedback throughout the application.

## Changes

### Added
- Developer Documentation homepage at `/docs/developer` with dedicated navigation and sidebar highlighting

  - Include unsupported traits (e.g. custom personality entries)

- Portrait section messaging updated to clarify that only `gpt-image-1` supports editing; DALL·E 2 and 3 do not

### Fixed
- Quest regeneration fallback logic improved to handle malformed or non-JSON responses gracefully
- Visual regeneration states now correctly trigger for dialogue, items, quests, and basic info sections

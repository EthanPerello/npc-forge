# NPC Forge v0.22.0 â€“ Portrait Regeneration Reliability & Random Generation Improvements

Release Date: May 27, 2025

## Summary

This release introduces reliability improvements for portrait regeneration, enhanced error handling with retry logic, and better UX safeguards for unsaved changes. It also upgrades random character generation logic to respect content preferences and apply usage limits consistently.

## Changes

### Added
- Unsaved changes warning banner on character edit pages when portrait modifications haven't been saved yet
- Enhanced error handling with retry logic for portrait generation failures
- Model-specific tips and generation status indicators in portrait section

### Changed
- Portrait regeneration on edit pages now requires explicit "Save Changes" action to persist modifications
- Improved error messages for portrait generation with specific guidance for different failure types (rate limits, quotas, network issues)
- Enhanced portrait generation reliability with automatic retry mechanism for temporary API failures

### Fixed
- Portrait regeneration no longer auto-saves changes without user confirmation on character edit pages
- Portrait generation errors now provide actionable feedback instead of generic failure messages
- API error handling now properly categorizes different types of failures (authentication, rate limits, server errors)
- Improved timeout handling and base64 validation for portrait generation requests
- Mobile stepper display now shows only step numbers on small screens to prevent text overflow and improve readability
- Random character generation now properly respects user's content type selections (portraits, quests, dialogue, items)
- Random character generation now correctly counts against monthly usage limits like regular character generation

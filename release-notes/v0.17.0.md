# NPC Forge v0.17.0 â€“ Wizard Flow & Layout Redesign

Release Date: May 15, 2025

This release introduces a redesigned character creation process featuring a step-by-step wizard interface, a revised character display layout, and UI improvements for better clarity, consistency, and user experience.

## Added
- Redesigned character creation flow with a new step-by-step wizard interface:
  - Four steps: Concept, Options, Model, Generate
  - Sticky top progress bar with clickable navigation
  - Welcome popup for first-time users introducing the flow
- Generate Random Character button that creates a default character and navigates directly to the final step
- Sticky footer rebuilt for the new wizard layout:
  - Step-aware controls for Continue, Back, and New Character
  - Progress indicators consistent across steps
- Revised character display layout:
  - Name, portrait, trait tags, and action buttons grouped on the left
  - Profile, quests, dialogue, and items shown in tabbed content on the right

## Changed
- Character creation form replaced: old tabbed layout removed in favor of a guided wizard experience
- Trait tags in character display and library modal now use Label: Value format and exclude non-trait metadata (e.g. appearance, personality, backstory)
- Header layout and image adjusted to ensure all five character faces are clearly visible across screen sizes
- Genre selection no longer auto-fills the description field

## Removed
- Legacy tabbed character creation interface and related components (e.g. main-form-tabs.tsx, character-form.tsx)

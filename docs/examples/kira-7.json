  "appearance": "Kira-7 stands at an average height, her athletic build lending her a sense of strength and agility. Her face is a chaotic blend of human and machine, with glowing circuitry weaving through her skin, providing an eerie illumination in dim lights.

The overall effect is both mesmerizing and unsettling.",

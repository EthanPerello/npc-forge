# Character Generation Options

Each step builds upon the previous ones, allowing you to create precisely the character you envision.

**Example Layered Description**:
```
Core: "A ship's navigator"
Visual: "with intricate tattoos marking sea routes"
Personality: "who never admits when lost"
Conflict: "haunted by a navigation error that sank her previous ship"
```

### Genre-Specific Optimization

**Fantasy Character Enhancement**:
• Include magical elements, species variations, or supernatural abilities
• Reference fantasy locations, organizations, or historical events
• Consider long lifespans and their impact on personality and knowledge

**Sci-Fi Character Enhancement**:
• Integrate technology, cybernetics, or genetic modifications
• Reference future societies, space travel, or advanced science
• Consider human-AI relationships or post-human evolution

**Historical Character Enhancement**:
• Research period-appropriate occupations, social structures, and technology
• Include historically accurate cultural details and social constraints
• Consider religious, political, or social movements of the era

**Contemporary Character Enhancement**:
• Ground characters in realistic modern professions and social contexts
• Include current technology and communication methods
• Reference contemporary cultural and social issues

### Strategic Model Usage

**Incremental Enhancement Approach**:
1. **Generate Base Character**: Use Standard models for initial creation
2. **Identify Key Elements**: Determine which aspects are most important
3. **Selective Regeneration**: Use Enhanced/Premium models for critical elements
4. **Final Polish**: Apply highest-tier models for finishing touches

**Content Priority Strategy**:
• **High Priority**: Character personality and backstory (use Enhanced/Premium)
• **Medium Priority**: Quests and dialogue (use Enhanced for important characters)
• **Lower Priority**: Items and additional traits (Standard often sufficient)

## Quality Optimization Tips

### Description Writing Best Practices

**Effective Techniques**:
• **Show, Don't Tell**: "Has nervous tics" vs. "Constantly taps fingers and avoids eye contact"
• **Specific Details**: "Wears armor" vs. "Wears dented chainmail with a family crest"
• **Implied Depth**: "Former soldier" vs. "Veteran who still checks exits in every room"

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
• **Overly Generic**: "A nice person who helps others"
• **Too Complex**: Multi-paragraph descriptions with excessive detail
• **Contradictory Elements**: Conflicting personality traits or background elements
• **Anachronistic Details**: Modern elements in historical settings

### Model Selection Strategy

**Efficiency Maximization**:
• **Test with Standard**: Experiment with concepts using lower-cost models
• **Upgrade Strategically**: Use higher tiers for characters you plan to keep
• **Mixed Approach**: Combine different model tiers (Standard text + Enhanced image)
• **Regeneration Planning**: Use lower models initially, upgrade specific elements later

**Quality Optimization**:
• **Character Importance**: Match model tier to character significance in your story
• **Content Type Focus**: Prioritize model upgrades for most important content types
• **Iterative Improvement**: Generate, evaluate, and selectively enhance

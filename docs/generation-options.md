# Character Generation Options

NPC Forge offers extensive customization options through its wizard-based interface. This guide provides a detailed breakdown of all available settings across the four-step creation process.

## Overview

The character creation wizard consists of four main steps:

1. **Concept**: Genre selection and character description
2. **Options**: Detailed trait and attribute customization  
3. **Model**: AI model selection for text and images
4. **Generate**: Character creation and results

## Step 1: Concept

**Sci-Fi Sub-Genres**:
- **Space Opera**: Epic adventures across galaxies with interstellar travel
- **Cyberpunk**: Near-future dystopias with high technology and corporate control

### Character Description

The free-text description field allows you to provide specific details about your character. More detailed descriptions typically result in more tailored characters.

**Example of a comprehensive description:**
> A scarred elven ranger who protects a sacred forest, harboring a secret connection to ancient magic that causes plants to grow in her footsteps. She wears leather armor adorned with living vines and carries a bow made from a branch of the oldest tree in the forest. Despite her mystical abilities, she's practical and down-to-earth, preferring actions over words.

**Tips for effective descriptions:**
- Include physical appearance details
- Mention personality traits
- Describe background or occupation
- Add unique abilities or characteristics
- Specify relationships or motivations

For examples of effective descriptions, see our [Character Examples](/docs/character-examples).

## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Effective Descriptions

1. **Be Specific**: Include concrete details about appearance, personality, and background
2. **Add Unique Elements**: Mention special abilities, quirks, or distinctive features
3. **Consider Context**: Think about how the character fits into your story or game
4. **Use Vivid Language**: Descriptive words help the AI create more interesting characters

### Choosing Options

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with genre/sub-genre, then add specific traits
2. **Balance Traits**: Choose complementary personality traits that create depth
3. **Consider Relationships**: Think about how traits affect the character's role
4. **Use Advanced Options**: Physical traits and background add authenticity

### Model Selection Strategy

1. **Match Importance to Quality**: Use higher tiers for important characters
2. **Consider Your Needs**: Standard tier is often sufficient for most uses
3. **Plan Your Budget**: Track usage to make the most of limited generations
4. **Experiment**: Try different models to see quality differences

### Portrait Optimization

1. **Less is More**: Over-specifying options can constrain the AI unnecessarily
2. **Art Style Consistency**: Use consistent art styles for characters in the same story
3. **Background Context**: Themed backgrounds can enhance character presentation
4. **Expression Matching**: Choose expressions that fit the character's personality

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Issues

- **Failed Generation**: Check internet connection, try simpler descriptions
- **Portrait Issues**: Reduce portrait specifications or try different art style
- **Unexpected Results**: Refine description or adjust trait selections

### Limit Issues

- **Reached Limit**: Wait for monthly reset or switch to unlimited Standard tier
- **Unexpected Usage**: Check which models are selected and their individual limits

### Navigation Problems

- **Stuck on Step**: Ensure all required fields are completed
- **Lost Progress**: Use browser back/forward or click progress bar steps

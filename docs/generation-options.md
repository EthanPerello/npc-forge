â€¢ Consider usage limits when choosing models

**Workflow Tips:**
â€¢ Start with small changes to test results

**Cost Considerations:**

## Advanced Trait Management (NEW in v0.21.0)

### Additional Traits System

The Additional Traits section in character editing provides comprehensive trait management:

â€¢ Maintains character consistency while refreshing specific aspects
â€¢ Each regeneration counts against text model usage limits

### Trait Management Best Practices

**Generating New Traits:**
â€¢ Use higher-tier models for more creative and fitting traits
â€¢ Generate traits that complement existing character personality
â€¢ Review generated traits and remove any that don't fit
â€¢ Balance trait quantity with character focus

**Regenerating Traits:**
â€¢ Regenerate traits that seem out of character or repetitive

â€¢ Keep trait lists focused and relevant

## Chat Integration

### How Chat Uses Models

When chatting with characters, the **text models** are used to generate responses:
â€¢ Each chat response counts as **one generation** against your monthly text model limit
â€¢ You can switch between models during conversations
â€¢ Higher-tier models provide more consistent character personalities
â€¢ Response quality and character voice depth improve with higher tiers

### Chat-Specific Model Considerations

**Standard (gpt-4o-mini):**
â€¢ Good for casual conversation and exploration
â€¢ Basic character personality consistency
â€¢ Suitable for frequent, low-stakes interactions

**Enhanced (gpt-4.1-mini):**
â€¢ Better character voice consistency
â€¢ More nuanced responses and personality depth
â€¢ Good balance of quality and usage limits

**Premium (gpt-4o):**
â€¢ Superior character personality depth and consistency
â€¢ Complex conversation handling and emotional nuance
â€¢ Best for important story moments and character development

## Usage Optimization Strategies

â€¢ Use trait generation/regeneration judiciously
â€¢ Plan character conversations around monthly limits

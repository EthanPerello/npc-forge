# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is NPC Forge?
NPC Forge is an AI-powered tool for creating detailed non-player characters (NPCs) for games, storytelling, and creative projects. It generates complete character profiles including name, appearance, personality, backstory, and an AI-created portrait.

### Is NPC Forge free to use?
Yes, NPC Forge is free to use with a limit of 15 character generations per month per device. This limit helps manage API costs while keeping the tool accessible.

### Do I need to create an account to use NPC Forge?
No, NPC Forge does not require an account or login. It works immediately in your browser without any signup process.

### What happens to my characters after I create them?
Your characters are not stored on our servers. You need to download them as JSON files to save them. We have no access to your generated characters once you leave the site.

### Which browsers are supported?
NPC Forge works best on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Make sure you're using an up-to-date browser for the best experience.

## Usage & Features

### How many characters can I generate?
The free version allows 15 character generations per month per device. This limit resets at the beginning of each month.

### Can I edit a character after it's generated?
Currently, you cannot directly edit a generated character within NPC Forge. However, you can:
1. Download the character as JSON
2. Make adjustments to your inputs
3. Generate a new character

A character editing feature is planned for a future release.

### Why are my portraits sometimes inconsistent with the character description?
While DALL-E 3 is powerful, it may not catch every detail in complex descriptions. For best results:
- Be specific about key visual elements
- Use the portrait customization options
- Focus on the most distinctive visual traits

### Can I use the characters I create commercially?
Yes, you can use the generated characters for commercial purposes. According to OpenAI's usage policies, content generated by their APIs belongs to the user. However, please check the latest [OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use) for any updates.

### How can I save my characters?
Click the "Download JSON" button on any generated character to save it to your device. This JSON file contains all character data and can be reimported into other tools.

### Is there a way to store characters in the browser?
Not yet, but a character library feature is planned for a future release. For now, be sure to download your characters as JSON files.

## Technical Questions

### How does NPC Forge work?
NPC Forge uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to generate character text and DALL-E 3 to create portraits. Your inputs and selections are processed into prompts that guide the AI in creating characters that match your specifications.

### Can I use NPC Forge offline?
No, NPC Forge requires an internet connection to function because it relies on OpenAI's API services.

### What happens to my data?
Your inputs are sent to OpenAI's API to generate content but are not stored. Generated characters exist only in your browser session until you download them. We do not collect or store character data.

### Why does character generation sometimes fail?
Generation might fail due to:
- Network issues
- OpenAI API limitations
- Content policy violations in your inputs
- Temporary service disruptions

Try simplifying your request or trying again later if you encounter problems.

### Are there any content restrictions?
Yes, NPC Forge follows OpenAI's content policy, which prohibits generating explicit sexual content, hateful content, or content that promotes illegal activities. Requests that violate these policies will be rejected.

### Why is there a usage limit?
The usage limit of 15 generations per month helps manage the API costs associated with running NPC Forge while keeping it free for everyone to use.

## Troubleshooting

### Portrait generation failed but my character was created. What happened?
Sometimes the portrait generation may fail while the character text succeeds. This can happen if:
- The portrait request times out
- The description contains elements that DALL-E filters block
- There's a temporary issue with the image generation service

You can still use the character without a portrait, or try generating a new character with adjusted descriptions.

### The character generation seems stuck. What should I do?
If generation seems to be taking too long (more than 30 seconds):
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Try a simpler character description
4. Clear your browser cache and retry

### How can I report issues or request features?
You can:
- Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/EthanPerello/npc-forge/issues)
- Contact the developer at [ethanperello@gmail.com](mailto:ethanperello@gmail.com)

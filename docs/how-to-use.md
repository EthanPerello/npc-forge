### Generation Issues

â€¢ **Character generation failed**: Check your internet connection and try again
â€¢ **Portrait generation failed**: Try with different portrait options
â€¢ **Slow generation**: Higher-tier models take longer; wait patiently

â€¢ **Poor results**: gpt-image-1 provides best editing quality

### Library Issues

â€¢ **Can't edit character**: Make sure it's a user-created character, not an example
â€¢ **Lost characters**: Characters are stored locally; they don't sync between devices

### Chat Issues

â€¢ **Chat not loading**: Verify the character exists in your library

â€¢ **Character responses inconsistent**: Try using higher-tier models for better consistency

â€¢ **Filter issues**: Traits only appear in filters after characters with those traits are saved

### Filtering Issues

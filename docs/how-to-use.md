## Troubleshooting

### Generation Issues

- **Character generation failed**: Check your internet connection and try again
- **Portrait generation failed**: Try with different portrait options
- **Slow generation**: Higher-tier models take longer; wait patiently

### Library Issues

- **Characters not saving**: Your browser storage might be full; delete old characters
- **Can't edit character**: Make sure it's a user-created character, not an example
- **Lost characters**: Characters are stored locally; they don't sync between devices

### Filtering Issues

- **Traits not appearing in filters**: Traits only appear after characters with those traits are saved
- **Search not working**: Check syntax for trait-specific searches (`category: value`)
- **Inconsistent results**: Check for variations in trait spelling

### Usage Limits

- **Unexpected limit reached**: Check which models you're using and their individual limits

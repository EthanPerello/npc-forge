# How to Use NPC Forge

NPC Forge is an AI-powered character generator for games, storytelling, and creative projects. This guide will walk you through the core functionality and features.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Choose a template or write a description

Start by selecting a genre template (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Historical, or Contemporary) or write your own character description. The more specific your description, the more tailored your character will be.

Example description:
> A scarred elven ranger who protects a sacred forest, harboring a secret connection to ancient magic.

Click the "Generate Character" button. The AI will process your inputs and create:
- Complete character profile with name, appearance, personality, backstory

- **Art Style**: Choose from realistic, fantasy art, anime, comic book, and more
- **Expression/Mood**: Set facial expression (neutral, happy, serious, etc.)
- **Framing**: Select portrait (head/shoulders), bust, full-body, or action poses
- **Background**: Choose plain backgrounds, gradients, themed environments, and more

> **Tip**: For best results, only specify the portrait options that are important to you. The AI often creates better portraits when given some creative freedom.

## Understanding Usage Limits

NPC Forge is limited to 15 character generations per month per device:

- **Monthly Reset**: Your generation count resets at the beginning of each month
- **Remaining Generations**: View your remaining generations in the usage indicator
- **Save Your Work**: Always download your characters as JSON files to keep them for future reference

## Advanced Tips

### Effective Descriptions

Write specific, evocative descriptions for better results. Include details about appearance, personality, background, and unique traits.

**Good example**: "A rogue android engineer living on a space station who modifies tech beyond legal limits. They have developed unique upgrades that give them an edge but also make them a target for corporate security forces."

**Basic example**: "A tech engineer in space."

### Using Templates

Genre templates provide excellent starting points. Each genre has several sub-genres with specialized characteristics:

- **Fantasy**: High Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Urban Fantasy, Sword & Sorcery
- **Sci-Fi**: Space Opera, Cyberpunk, Post-Apocalyptic, Hard Sci-Fi
- **Historical**: Medieval, Ancient Civilizations, Renaissance, Age of Sail
- **Contemporary**: Urban Life, Mystery & Thriller, Supernatural, Slice of Life

### Character Iterations

If you're not satisfied with a generated character:
1. Adjust your inputs (try more specific descriptions)
2. Generate again
3. Repeat until you get the desired result

### Randomizing Options

Use the "Randomize Options" button to quickly generate new character traits if you're feeling stuck or want inspiration.

### Clear Options

The "Clear Options" button lets you reset all character traits while preserving your description and portrait settings.

## Example Use Cases

- **Game Developers**: Create NPCs for your games with consistent traits and backstories
- **Tabletop RPG Players**: Generate memorable characters for your campaigns
- **Writers & Worldbuilders**: Develop supporting characters for your stories

## Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Issues

â€¢ **Character generation failed**: Check your internet connection and try again
â€¢ **Portrait generation failed**: Try with different portrait options
â€¢ **Slow generation**: Higher-tier models take longer; wait patiently

### Library Issues

â€¢ **Characters not saving**: Your browser storage might be full; delete old characters
â€¢ **Can't edit character**: Make sure it's a user-created character, not an example
â€¢ **Lost characters**: Characters are stored locally; they don't sync between devices

### Chat Issues

â€¢ **Chat not loading**: Verify the character exists in your library
â€¢ **Messages not sending**: Check your monthly usage limits for the selected model
â€¢ **Character responses inconsistent**: Try using higher-tier models for better consistency

### Filtering Issues

â€¢ **Traits not appearing in filters**: Traits only appear after characters with those traits are saved
â€¢ **Search not working**: Check syntax for trait-specific searches (`category: value`)
â€¢ **Inconsistent results**: Check for variations in trait spelling

### Usage Limits

â€¢ **Reached monthly limit**: Wait for the monthly reset or use Standard tier
â€¢ **Unexpected limit reached**: Check which models you're using and their individual limits
â€¢ **Chat usage**: Remember that chat responses count against text model limits

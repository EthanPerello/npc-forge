# How to Use NPC Forge

NPC Forge is an AI-powered character generator featuring a step-by-step wizard interface for creating detailed NPCs. This guide covers the wizard-based creation process, character library management, interactive chat features, and the portrait editing and trait management capabilities.

## Quick Start Guide

### Welcome to the Wizard

When you first visit NPC Forge, you'll see a welcome popup that introduces the wizard interface. The wizard guides you through four steps to create your character.

### Step 1: Concept

**Choose your foundation:**

â€¢ **Select a Genre**: Pick from Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Historical, or Contemporary
â€¢ **Pick a Sub-Genre**: Choose from 16 specialized templates

**Example description:**
```
A scarred elven ranger who protects a sacred forest, harboring a secret connection to ancient magic that causes plants to grow in her footsteps.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Issues

â€¢ **Character generation failed**: Check your internet connection and try again
â€¢ **Portrait generation failed**: Try with different portrait options
â€¢ **Slow generation**: Higher-tier models take longer; wait patiently

### Portrait Editing Issues

â€¢ **Edit button disabled**: Ensure character has existing portrait and compatible model selected
â€¢ **Editing failed**: Try simpler edit prompts or use gpt-image-1 model
â€¢ **Poor results**: gpt-image-1 provides best editing quality; DALLÂ·E 2 has limited capabilities, DALLÂ·E 3 doesn't support editing

### Library Issues

â€¢ **Characters not saving**: Your browser storage might be full; delete old characters
â€¢ **Can't edit character**: Make sure it's a user-created character, not an example
â€¢ **Lost characters**: Characters are stored locally; they don't sync between devices

### Chat Issues

â€¢ **Chat not loading**: Verify the character exists in your library
â€¢ **Messages not sending**: Check your monthly usage limits for the selected model
â€¢ **Character responses inconsistent**: Try using higher-tier models for better consistency

### Trait Management Issues

â€¢ **Traits not appearing**: Check that traits meet length and format requirements
â€¢ **Regeneration failed**: Try different prompts or check usage limits
â€¢ **Filter issues**: Traits only appear in filters after characters with those traits are saved

### Visual Feedback Issues (NEW)

â€¢ **Loading indicators not appearing**: Refresh the page if visual feedback isn't working
â€¢ **Button transitions not working**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

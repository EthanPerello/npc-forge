## Chat Integration

### How Chat Uses Models

When chatting with characters, the **text models** are used to generate responses:
â€¢ Each chat response counts as **one generation** against your monthly text model limit
â€¢ You can switch between models during conversations
â€¢ Higher-tier models provide more consistent character personalities
â€¢ Response quality and character voice depth improve with higher tiers

### Chat-Specific Model Considerations

â€¢ More consistent character voice and personality
â€¢ Improved understanding of character context and traits

**Premium Model for Chat:**
â€¢ Best for critical story moments and main character interactions
â€¢ Highest quality character voice and personality consistency
â€¢ Most sophisticated understanding of character relationships and background

## Trait Generation Integration

### Text Models for Trait Generation

**Standard Model (gpt-4o-mini):**

### Trait Generation Usage

â€¢ **Add Generated Trait**: Counts as one text generation
â€¢ **Regenerate Individual Traits**: Each regeneration counts as one text generation  
â€¢ **Multiple Trait Generation**: Generating several traits at once counts as one generation
â€¢ **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate tier based on character importance

## Usage Strategy

### Monthly Planning

**Recommended Strategy**:
â€¢ Use Standard models for most characters and casual chat
â€¢ Reserve Enhanced tier for important characters and meaningful conversations
â€¢ Save Premium tier for critical main characters and key story interactions
â€¢ Plan portrait editing carefully with gpt-image-1's limited monthly quota

### Model Combination Tips

**Efficient Combinations**:
â€¢ Standard Text + Enhanced Image: Good balance for most characters
â€¢ Enhanced Text + Standard Image: Better character depth with quick visualization
â€¢ Premium Text + Premium Image: Maximum character development with editing capabilities

**Chat-Focused Strategy**:
â€¢ Start conversations with Standard model to establish character voice
â€¢ Switch to Enhanced/Premium for important character development moments
â€¢ Use Premium sparingly for crucial story revelations or emotional scenes

**Portrait Editing Strategy**:
â€¢ Generate initial portraits with dall-e-3 for quality
â€¢ Reserve gpt-image-1 for characters needing editing
â€¢ Plan edits carefully due to low monthly limits
â€¢ Use editing for refinements rather than complete redesigns

## Usage Tracking

### Monthly Limits

Each model tier has individual monthly limits:
â€¢ Limits reset on the 1st of each month
â€¢ Tracking is per device/browser
â€¢ Development mode bypasses limits for testing
â€¢ **Chat conversations count against text model limits**

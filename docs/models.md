# Model Selection Guide

NPC Forge offers multiple AI models with different capabilities and usage limits. This guide explains the tiered model system and helps you choose the right models for your needs.

## Overview

Each type offers three tiers with different quality levels and monthly usage limits.

- Premium Text + Enhanced Image: Maximum character depth with quality portraits

## Usage Tracking

### Monthly Limits

Each model tier has individual monthly limits:
- Limits reset on the 1st of each month
- Tracking is per device/browser
- Development mode bypasses limits for testing

### Limit Display

The interface shows:
- Remaining generations for each model
- Current month's usage
- Warning when approaching limits

## Regeneration with Models

When editing characters, you can:
- Regenerate individual attributes with different text models
- Update portraits with different image models
- Mix and match models for optimal results

### Regeneration Strategy

1. **Start with Standard**: Generate initial character
2. **Identify Key Areas**: Determine which aspects need improvement
3. **Selective Upgrade**: Regenerate specific elements with higher-tier models
4. **Final Polish**: Use Premium models for critical final touches

## Quality Differences

### Text Model Comparison

- **Standard**: Basic but functional character profiles
- **Enhanced**: More nuanced personalities and backstories
- **Premium**: Rich, complex character development

### Image Model Comparison

- **DALL-E 2**: Clear, recognizable portraits
- **DALL-E 3**: Enhanced detail and artistic quality

## Best Practices

### Efficient Usage

1. **Plan Your Month**: Identify which characters need higher-tier models
2. **Start Low, Upgrade High**: Generate with Standard, regenerate important parts with Premium
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track your monthly consumption
4. **Strategic Saving**: Reserve high-tier models for important characters

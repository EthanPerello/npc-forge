# Model Selection Guide

NPC Forge offers multiple AI models with different capabilities and usage limits. This guide explains the tiered model system, helps you choose the right models for your needs, and provides tips for optimizing your usage.

## Overview

NPC Forge uses two types of AI models:
- **Text Models**: For generating character attributes, quests, dialogue, and items
- **Image Models**: For creating character portraits

Each type offers three tiers with different quality levels and usage limits.

### Monthly Planning

**Standard Strategy** (Most Users):

- Reserve Enhanced tier for 5-10 important characters per month
- Save Premium tier for 2-3 critical characters

**Balanced Strategy** (Regular Users):
- Mix of Standard and Enhanced for variety
- Use Premium sparingly for special occasions
- Monitor usage throughout the month

**Premium Strategy** (Quality-Focused):
- Primarily Enhanced and Premium models
- Standard only for quick concepts
- Careful planning of monthly generation budget

### Model Combination Tips

**Efficient Combinations:**
- Standard Text + Enhanced Image: Good balance of quality and usage
- Enhanced Text + Standard Image: Better descriptions with quick visualization
- Premium Text + Enhanced Image: Maximum character depth with quality portraits

**Cost-Effective Approach:**
- Generate with Standard models first
- Regenerate important characters with higher tiers
- Use Enhanced/Premium selectively for final versions

## Usage Tracking

### Monitoring Your Limits

The interface displays:
- Remaining generations for each model
- Current month's usage
- Most constrained model when multiple are selected
- Warning indicators when approaching limits

### Monthly Reset

All usage limits reset on the 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC.

### Development Mode Override

In development environments, usage limits are bypassed for testing purposes.

## Regeneration with Models

### Selective Regeneration

When editing characters, you can:
- Regenerate individual attributes with different text models
- Update portraits with different image models
- Mix and match models for optimal results

### Regeneration Strategy

1. **Start with Standard**: Generate initial character with unlimited model
2. **Identify Key Areas**: Determine which aspects need improvement
3. **Selective Upgrade**: Regenerate specific elements with higher-tier models
4. **Final Polish**: Use Premium models for critical final touches

## Quality Differences

### Text Model Comparison

**Character Depth:**
- Standard: Basic but functional character profiles
- Enhanced: More nuanced personalities and backstories
- Premium: Rich, complex character development

**Narrative Consistency:**
- Standard: Generally consistent within character
- Enhanced: Better internal logic and coherence
- Premium: Seamless narrative integration

**Creative Details:**
- Standard: Straightforward descriptions
- Enhanced: More creative and interesting details
- Premium: Highly creative and unique elements

### Image Model Comparison

**Visual Quality:**
- DALL-E 2: Clear, recognizable portraits
- DALL-E 3: Enhanced detail and artistic quality
- gpt-image-1: Maximum visual fidelity and style control

**Style Adherence:**
- DALL-E 2: Basic style interpretation
- DALL-E 3: Better understanding of artistic styles
- gpt-image-1: Precise style and mood control

## Best Practices

### Efficient Usage

1. **Plan Your Month**: Identify which characters need higher-tier models
2. **Start Low, Upgrade High**: Generate with Standard, regenerate important parts with Premium
3. **Batch Similar Characters**: Generate related characters together for consistency
4. **Save Premium for Finals**: Use highest tier for completed, final characters

### Quality Optimization

1. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide rich context regardless of model tier
2. **Specific Traits**: Well-defined characteristics improve output quality
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Use regeneration to refine character elements
4. **Model Matching**: Match model tier to character importance

### Cost Management

1. **Track Usage**: Monitor your monthly consumption regularly
2. **Strategic Saving**: Reserve high-tier models for month-end if needed
3. **Standard First**: Use unlimited Standard models for experimentation
4. **Selective Regeneration**: Only regenerate elements that need improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Model Selection Issues

**Model Not Available:**
- Check if you've reached monthly limit
